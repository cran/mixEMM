Description: Contains functions for estimating a mixed-effects model for
             clustered data (or batch-processed data) with cluster-level (or batch-
             level) missing values in the outcome, i.e., the outcomes of some 
             clusters are either all observed or missing altogether. The model is 
             developed for analyzing incomplete data from labeling-based quantitative 
             proteomics experiments but is not limited to this type of data. 
             We used an expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm for model 
             estimation. The cluster-level missingness may depend on the average 
             value of the outcome in the cluster (missing not at random).
